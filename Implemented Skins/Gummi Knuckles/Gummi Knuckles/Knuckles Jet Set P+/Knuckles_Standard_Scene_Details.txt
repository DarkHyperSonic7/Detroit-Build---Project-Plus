DISCLAIMER: The PM Knuckles pose is MIRRORED. Importing this pose will be different than normal. 

1. Import your model and import the pose using the .anim scripts. The model will look weird, this is normal.
2. Scale it to .5, set the X scale to NEGATIVE. The model should look normal but the pose is mirrored.
3. Apply the armature modifier on every object to "bake" the pose onto the model.
4. Create a new empty at 0,0,0, select all the Knuckles objects and select the empty. Set it as the parent.
5. Set the X scale on the Empty to -1.
6. Apply the normal model and eye transformations down below.
